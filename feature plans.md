# feature plans for fuzzy file matcher

- auto generated suggestions should be populated with accept or reject
  - on reject, it should populate the search bar in order to finish the working document off immediately
- check on session restoration 
- ability to select folder for the file path list
- change UI, move teres file tracker down, make it readable 
- check on order of selection of mapping 

- see if indentation can be added bulk matching (how does order get selected?) prolly show staging before confirming a mapping 
(implement a counting on click?)

After AG Grid --
- Now what about auto match?
- remove .DSstore in filenames
- introducing natural sort in AG Grid (1, 10,11,...2,20,21..etc is wrong)
- try AG Grid even for client references
